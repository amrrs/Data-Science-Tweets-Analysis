# Data-Science-Tweets-Analysis

Contains my analysis of tweets around the subject of **Data Science**. 

I divided the tasks into three sections:
- Scraped thr tweets from Twitter (needs thr Twitter API creds) using `tweepy`
- Performed basic EDA (includes a word cloud)
- Generated the sentiment polarity scores of the tweets using `Vader`
